# AirPark


Have you ever been in a situation where you just cannot find parking, and your only option is to grudgingly check into a parking lot that costs $40 for a few hours? The sad truth is that when you are paying an exorbitant sum of money for a parking lot, thousands of personal parking spots are completely empty because their owners are not at home or in the office. Those days are now over. Introducing AirPark, a mobile platform for affordable and efficient sharing of personal parking lots. AirPark makes the process of  buying and renting personal parking spots EXTREMELY easy, time-efficient, and affordable. 

Renters simply add their parking spot with the click of a button, and our app automatically detects the location where they are reporting from. Next, the renter can either rent out their parking spot one-time, or create weekly rent schedules. The buyer on the other hand can search for nearby parking spots, or search by address for a remote spot, and then claim it. When they are leaving the spot, they can simply click a button to checkout and pay. Our system makes it more affordable for buyers, while benefiting renters. Airpark is also google assistant enabled for voice interactions. 

On the business side of things, we plan to take 0.5% service fee on each transaction, as well as host in-app advertisements. We will also take a 1% service free on transactions above a threshold. 

Our tech stack is as follows:
* React Native for front-end.
* Python with azure serverless functions for back-end.
* Amazon RDS with SQL for database.
* Figma for UI design
* Google assistant

In the future, we would like to add an interface for reporting spam spots, and creating a rating system for each spot. We would also like to integrate AirPark with automatic reader scanning systems in personal parking spots. Lastly, we would like to implement more sophisticated filters for searching.
